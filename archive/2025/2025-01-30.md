  - [Yes, people sometimes resort to name-calling when they feel they can't manipulate someone because it's a way to exert control or lash out when their usual tactics aren't working, often stemming from feelings of frustration, powerlessness, or insecurity; essentially using verbal aggression as a last resort to try and undermine the other person's confidence and agency. When a person is intelligent and smart enough to envision your every single move before few months or years and outwit you in your own game - you end up name-calling them . Never be afraid to fight for what's right . Never be afraid to call "Black" a black cause it requires guts to say it right on the face which rest of society](https://x.com/binitamshah/status/1884524888180052217)
