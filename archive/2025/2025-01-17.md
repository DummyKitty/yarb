  - [Sometimes you need to leave and relinquish everything and just concentrate on your inner growth. It's not a crime to care for yourself , love your own selves - without being made to feel chagrin or embezzled with the title of "Being selfish" . Love those who love you, care for those who care for you Challenge yourself to new mental paramours. Life is much rewarding when you start concentrating on your own inner growth without wondering who will say or think what for you . Go beyond that horizon! What you think of yourself is what should matter to you on the long run that's it !](https://x.com/binitamshah/status/1879720185877143898)
